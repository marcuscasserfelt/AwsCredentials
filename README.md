# AwsCredentials

Build or publish and then make a shortcut to the executable. 

Example for powershell:

```powershell 
notepad $profile
```

and then add this to make a "cred" shortcut:

*function cred { C:\repos\AwsCredentials\AwsCredentials\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish\AwsCredentials.exe }*
